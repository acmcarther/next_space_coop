# 0.6.1 (October 30, 2016)

* Update dependency of `libc` to 0.2.16
* Fix channel `dec` logic
* Fix a timer bug around timeout cancellation
* Don't allocate buffers for TCP reads on Windows
* Touched up documentation in a few places
* Fix an infinite looping timer thread on OSX
* Fix compile on 32-bit OSX

# 0.6.0 (September 2, 2016)

* Shift primary API towards `Poll`
* `EventLoop` and types to `deprecated` mod. All contents of the
  `deprecated` mod will be removed by Mio 1.0.
* Increase minimum supported Rust version to 1.9.0
* Deprecate unix domain socket implementation in favor of using a
  version external to Mio. For example: https://github.com/alexcrichton/mio-uds.
* Remove various types now included in `std`
* Updated TCP & UDP APIs to match the versions in `std`
* Enable implementing `Evented` for any type via `Registration`
* Rename `IoEvent` -> `Event`
* Access `Event` data via functions vs. public fields.
* Expose `Events` as a public type that is passed into `Poll`
* Use `std::time::Duration` for all APIs that require a time duration.
* Polled events are now retrieved via `Events` type.
* Implement `std::error::Error` for `TimerError`
* Relax `Send` bound on notify messages.
* Remove `Clone` impl for `Timeout` (future proof)
* Remove `mio::prelude`
* Remove `mio::util`
* Remove dependency on bytes

# 0.5.0 (December 3, 2015)

* Windows support (#239)
* NetBSD support (#306)
* Android support (#295)
* Don't re-export bytes types
* Renamed `EventLoop::register_opt` to `EventLoop::register` (#257)
* `EventLoopConfig` is now a builder instead of having public struct fields. It
  is also no longer `Copy`. (#259)
* `TcpSocket` is no longer exported in the public API (#262)
* Integrate with net2. (#262)
* `TcpListener` now returns the remote peer address from `accept` as well (#275)
* The `UdpSocket::{send_to, recv_from}` methods are no longer generic over `Buf`
  or `MutBuf` but instead take slices directly. The return types have also been
  updated to return the number of bytes transferred. (#260)
* Fix bug with kqueue wher ean error on registration prevented the
  changelist from getting flushed (#276)
* Support sending/receiving FDs over UNIX sockets (#291)
* Mio's socket types are permanently associated with an EventLoop (#308)
* Reduce unnecessary poll wakeups (#314)
