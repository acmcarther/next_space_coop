Brought in a more recent bazel (4.2.0)

Need to push that to nix pkgs.

Had to patch the java to let me override the bazel shell in non-bsd or windows env.

Had to patch-elf the rust version that comes down the pipe. If you see "rustc: No such file or directory" even though the executable is there, thats because you didn't patchelf.

No idea how to fix this "scalably". Maybe someone else has already solved the problem somewhere else.
