space_coop
==========

This is the directory for the bazel test bed project, space_coop

It is imagined as a kind of cooperative game in a space setting.

Some themes are:

- Unforgiving gameplay (dying is fun)
- Managing complex systems
- Automating all the things

The original incarnation of this project was as a space station 13 clone, but it may evolve more into something else.
