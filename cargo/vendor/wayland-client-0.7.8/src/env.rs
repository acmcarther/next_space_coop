/// Utility type to handle the registry and global objects
///
/// This struct provides you with a generic handler for the `wl_registry`
/// and the instanciation of global objects.
///
/// To use it, you need to declare your globals of interest using the
/// `wayland_env!(..)` macro. Then, insert this handler in your event loop and
/// register your registry to it.
///
/// Once this handler is fully initialized (and all globals have been
/// instanciated), it makes them usable via deref-ing towards the struct
/// previously declared by the `wayland_env!(...)` macro.
///
/// The `globals()` method also give you a list of all globals declared by
/// the server, had them been instanciated or not. It is perfectly safe
/// to instanciate again a global that have already been instanciated.
///
/// This list is updated whenever the server declares or removes a global object,
/// (as long as you don't change the handler associated to your registry).
///
/// If you want to manage all you globals manually, but still want to use
/// this utility to maintain the list of evailable globals, you can simply
/// create an empty env type using the macro, like this : `wayland_env!(WaylandEnv)`.
/// No global will be automatically instanciated for you, but you still can use
/// this `globals()` method.
///
/// ## example of use
///
/// ```ignore
/// // Declare your globals of interest using the macro.
/// // This creates a struct named WaylandEnv (but you can change it).
/// wayland_env!(WaylandEnv, compositor: wl_compositor::WlCompositor);
///
/// let registry = display.get_registry();
/// let env_id = eventqueue.add_handler(EnvHandler::<WaylandEnv>::new());
/// eventqueue.register::<_, EnvHandler<WaylandEnv>>(&registry, env_id);
/// // a roundtrip sync will dispatch all event declaring globals to the handler
/// eventqueue.sync_roundtrip().unwrap();
/// // then, we can access them via the state of the event queue:
/// let state = eventqueue.state();
/// let env = state.get_handler::<EnvHandler<WaylandEnv>>(env_id);
/// // We can now access the globals as fields of env.
/// // Note that is some globals were missing, this acces (via Deref)
/// // will panic!
/// let compositor = env.compositor;
/// ```

/// will be bound in the environment struct.
///
/// This utility will interpret all globals declared in this macro as _necessary_, and
/// thus will not give you access to anything util they have all been declared by the compositor.
/// As such, only declare globals that your application cannot run without, like probably
/// `wl_compositor`, `wl_shm` or `wl_seat`. If there are globals that you can optionnaly
/// use, you'll have to instanciate them manually via `WlRegistry::bind(..)`.
